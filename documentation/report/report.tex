% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


%\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
%  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
%  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
%\else
%  % normal IEEE
%  \usepackage{cite}
%\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.

%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in

% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
\usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a system using Machine Learning to prevent XSS attacks on web applications.
    A deep neural network is built using the Keras library in Python and training using the CSIC 2010 dataset
    and data retrieved from \url{pastebin.org}. This neural network is then used to classify incoming HTTP requests
    according to whether they are XSS attacks or not.
    It was found that the system we developed blocks most attacks. A test using 25 XSS vectors showed an 84\% success
    rate, which can be improved upon. The improvement in our case would come from developing better Machine Learning
    classifiers.

\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}
% Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual
% with the very first section heading (almost always called "Introduction").
% They place it ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls does not automatically do
% this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided
% \IEEEraisesectionheading{} command. Note the need to keep any \label that
% is to refer to the section immediately after \section in the above as
% \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.




% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} article serves as documentation of the background for an application we have built, which uses
Machine Learning to prevent XSS attacks on web applications.

Following on from the suggestions set out in Section F of \citep*{nunan}.
Further research has been conducted in~\citep*{khan}.
Together these two papers will form the basis for an implementation of a software system that uses
machine learning techniques to automatically classify and detect XSS attacks such that these can be prevented.
A classifier will be trained using the CSIC 2010 HTTP~\citep*{csic2010} dataset and various XSS vectors
found on pastebin~\citep*{pastebin}, respectively.
Then the efficiency of the classifier will be tested on a live system running a
web application known to be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

We will start by placing XSS attacks in context and give an outline of what has been done so far in this area.
Then we will described the architecture we have designed our prevention system around.
After that we will discuss how we are using Machine Learning and the data sets we used to train the models
we employ for classification of incoming HTTP requests.
After that we will describe how we tested our application and give measures for how efficient it is in preventing XSS
attacks.
Finally we conclude what effect our intrusion prevention has had, what its strengths and weaknesses, respectively, are,
and how it can be improved.

The system has been deployed at \url{http://docker.math.fo/}, where two vulnerable web applications have been deployed,
\url{http://docker.math.fo/dvwa/} and \url{http://docker.math.fo/mutidillae}. If you want to look at the code in order
to deploy it yourself you can find it along with a \verb|docker-compose.yml| file with necessary dependencies
for deployment can be found on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/sigmundv/xss-prevent-py}. The web applications are
running in docker containers, but our system has been deployed on the host server. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:a} for
more detailed instruction on how to deploy the solution.

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

\section{Background}

Most of the text in this section has been adapted from \citep*{khan}.
Due to the advancement of modern computers and our dependence on internet based services,
web applications have become a primary target for cyber criminals.
According to \citep*{symantec}, about 430 million unique pieces of malware were discovered;
a growth of 36\% compared to 2014.

Cyber criminals use malicious code and malicious URLs to attack individuals and
organisations for personal, financial and political gains.
Detection of these attacks becomes an important security challenge in cybersecurity.

OWASP, Open Web Application Security Project, has ranked Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) as the third most critical
vulnerability on their latest top ten list from 2013 -- a new list is due in November 2017, but the top six
vulnerabilities are not being amended from the 2013 list \citep*{owasp}.

Currently XSS represents 43\% of all reported vulnerabilities.
XSS attacks work by injecting malicious scripts around benign code in a legitimate website in order to access cookies,
session information and other sensitive information retained by the user's web browser.
XSS attacks are applied to the client side of web applications whereas SQL injections --
the most critical vulnerability on OWASP's top ten list -- are server side attacks.
XSS attacks are targeting the application layer of the network hierarchy seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in the
application itself as opposed to the network connection itself.

About 70\% of attacks are reported to occur at the application layer, and these attacks are executed by executing
malicious JavaScript in a user's web browser, but another vehicle for XSS is malicious and obfuscated URLs \citep*{nunan}.
In contrast to different sorts of network based attacks, malicious JavaScript is difficult to detect \citep*{kloft}.
JavaScript attacks are performed by examining the vulnerability and exploiting it using JavaScript obscuration
techniques to evade detection, hence detecting such JavaScript in real-time is imperative.
Current security solutions are fundamentally based on two different approaches, signature-based
and heuristic-based detection.

The signature-based approach is based on the detection of unique
string patterns within the attacker's code, hence this fails whenever a new unknown string appears in the code,
which leaves the application vulnerable until the signatures in the detection system can be updated.
Cybercriminals can exploit this gap in time where the application is vulnerable to launch many attacks.
The heuristic detection approach is based on decision rules formulated by security experts.

The advantage is that this approach can not only detect currently know attacks, but also previously unknown attacks.
On the other hand the disadvantages are that scanning and analysis of incoming traffic is slow and that it introduces
a high number of false positives, which means that a piece of code is identified as malicious when it is not.
Researchers have recently started using machine learning in the detection of malware

The advantage of using machine learning is that we can easily detect previously unknown malware based on what we have
taught the machine learning model, i.e. classifier, about the nature of malicious JavaScript,
hence it is a very useful approach for detection of malware of an increasingly polymorphic nature.
Several approaches have been proposed for classification and detection of malicious JavaScript code such as
\citep*{rieck}, \citep*{curtsinger}, and \citep*{fraiwan}, but the problem with these approaches is the
overhead in the time needed for detection.

Thus a new, more efficient approach is needed for classification and detection of malicious JavaScript in an XSS attack,
and by following the method outlined in \citep*{khan} this project aims to build a new detection system that uses
machine learning classifiers to detect malicious pieces of JavaScript injected into a web application.

The reason I settled on XSS is that it is a critical vulnerability focused on by OWASP and that there is not
very much work in this area, so there is an opportunity to make something quite cutting-edge.


\section{Technical Approach}

\subsection{Data Preparation and Training of Classifier}
\label{sec:machine-learning}

The claims made here about the efficiency of the selected approach are from the article \citep*{khan}.
The approach proposed here is light-weight in nature with minimal runtime overheads.
Detection of XSS attacks is based on static analysis of a given JavaScript code from which
features will be extracted and fed into the machine learning classifier that determines whether it is
malicious piece of JavaScript code or not.

We are using the Keras library \citep*{keras} for Python to build our classifier.
This is a machine learning library that builds on top of the TensorFlow library \citep*{tensorflow} from Google.
This is a library that can be used to build models based of deep neural networks.
We use the more user friendly Keras library to build our model/classifier instead of using TensorFlow directly.

The data used to train the classifier comes from two different sources:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The HTTP Dataset CSIC 2010 \citep*{csic2010}, which contains 36,000 normal requests
    and more than 25,000 anomalous requests including XSS attacks.
    We filtered out the XSS related requests from this dataset.
    See Listing~\ref{lst:csic2010} for an example of this dataset.

    \item XSS vectors posted in various pastebins on \url{pastebin.org} \citep*{pastebin}.
    See Listing~\ref{lst:pastebin-data} for an example of one of these datasets.
\end{enumerate}

\end{lstlisting}


In order to use this data we need to build a matrix of features, i.e. transform the textual data into a set of numbers,
because this is what the machine learning algorithm understands.

The feature matrix will be built by first picking out a series of strings that normally appear in XSS vectors.
We call this the \emph{vocabulary} and feed it into the \verb|CountVectorizer| class of the scikit-learn
\citep*{scikit-learn} \citep*{sklearn_api} library together with the datasets mentioned above.
The \verb|CountVectorizer| class will then go through each row of data and count the number of occurrences per row
of each of the strings in the vocabulary. See Listing~\ref{lst:vocabulary} for the vocabulary we are using.
Each line in this vocabulary is what we referred to as the \emph{features} earlier.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={The vocabulary we use as basis for our classifier.},
                    label={lst:vocabulary}]
document.location
document.cookie
javascript:alert
&lt;script&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
onpagehide
&lt;
&gt;

\end{lstlisting}


When we have the feature matrix we can feed that into the Keras library and train a neural network to predict whether
a payload is an XSS vector or not. See Listing~\ref{lst:vectorize} for the Python code that is building a feature matrix
given a dataset and a vocabulary, and Listing~\ref{lst:train} for the Python code that is training the neural network.

    """
    vocabulary = open(vocabulary_file, 'r').read().splitlines()

    vocabulary_lengths = list(map(len, vocabulary))
    min_length = np.min(vocabulary_lengths)
    max_length = np.max(vocabulary_lengths)

    count_vect = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(min_length, max_length),
                                 analyzer='char',
                                 token_pattern=r'(?u).*\w.*\w+.',

    x_train_counts = count_vect.fit_transform(data).toarray()

    return count_vect, x_train_counts

\end{lstlisting}

    dataset = np.loadtxt(fname, delimiter=',')
    nrows, ncols = dataset.shape
    X = dataset[:, :(ncols-1)]
    Y = dataset[:, (ncols-1)]
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=(ncols-1), activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(ncols-1, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(X, Y, validation_split=0.33, epochs=10, batch_size=10)
    return model

\end{lstlisting}


Now we have the trained model and we are ready to incorporate it into our prevention system.


\subsection{Intrusion Prevention System}
\label{sec:ips}

In Section~\ref{sec:machine-learning} we have described how we prepare a dataset and train a classifier
for classification of HTTP requests. Now we will continue describing the architecture of the Intrusion Prevention System
and how we use the classifier to block incoming XSS attacks.

The starting point of the system is to use a firewall to direct the incoming requests towards our application.
For our purpose we use the \verb|iptables| firewall on a Linux system. IPtables has a built-in target called
\verb|NFQUEUE|, netfilter queue, which has the purpose of forwarding incoming packets to a userland application
that then processes these packets. In our case we look for packets with an HTTP layer, extract the Path
(in the case of a \verb|GET| request) or the payload (in the case of a \verb|POST| or \verb|PUT| request) and either
accept the packet, or drop it, according to the verdict given by our classifier from Section~\ref{sec:machine-learning}.

To analyse the incoming packets we use a Python library called Scapy~\citep*{scapy}. By default Scapy does not provide
a straightforward way to extract the HTTP layer from packets, so for that purpose we use the library
scapy-http~\citep*{scapy-http}, which adds HTTP support to Scapy. This allows us to get the information described above
from the packets, which we then pass to the neural network classifier.

Furthermore, in the case where the classifier is determining a packet to contain an XSS attack we store the payload used
in a CouchDB database for later analysis. CouchDB stores the data in the form of JSON documents, and the structure of
the documents can be seen in Listing~\ref{lst:couchdb}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={The Python function that stores information about XSS attacks in CouchDB.},
                    label={lst:couchdb}]
def store_xss_vector(self, source, path, payload, category):
    """

    :param source: The IP where the attack originated from.
    :param path: The path of the page where the attack was performed.
    :param payload: The payload that was used in the attack, e.g. a pice of JavaScript.
    :param category: The category determined by the classifier; will always be one.
    """
    doc_id = uuid.uuid4().hex
    self.database[doc_id] = {'timeid': arrow.now().timestamp,
                             'source': source, 'path': path,
                             'payload': payload, 'xss_vector': category}

\end{lstlisting}


Now when we have seen a description of the architecture it is helpful to illustrate the same in a diagra.
See Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} for this diagram and Figure~\ref{fig:flowchart} for a flowchart showing
the flow in the system. Additionally, see Figure~\ref{fig:classes} for a class diagram showing the
classes present in the system.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{system-diagram}
    \caption{Diagram showing the components of the Intrusion Prevention System and how they are interconnected.}

        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{class-diagram}
    \caption{Class diagram showing the classes being used in our application..}
    \label{fig:classes}
\end{figure}

To round off this section we can take a look at the Python functions that do the bulk of the work, the \verb|analyze_packet|
and \verb|classify_packet| functions, respectively. The former (see Listing~\ref{lst:analyze}) strips out the payload from the
incoming packet and returns it to the latter function (see Listing~\ref{lst:classify}), which passes it to the classifier, and then accepts or drops
the packet depending on the verdict returned by the classifier.


\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={The analyze\_packet function, which strips out the payloyad from a packet.},
                                                label={lst:analyze}]
    def analyze_packet(self, packet):
        """

        :param packet:
        :return:
        """
        payload = packet.get_payload()
        pkt = scapy.all.IP(payload)
        source = pkt.src
        if pkt.haslayer(self.http_request):

            http_request = pkt.getlayer(self.http_request)
            host = http_request.Host
            method = http_request.Method
            path = http_request.Path

            if method == b"GET":
                path_split = path.split(b"?")
                path = path_split[0]
                load = b"?".join(path_split[1:])
                logging.debug("%s request path found: %s", method, path)
                return source, host, path.decode("utf-8"), [html.escape(unquote(unquote(load.decode("utf-8"))))]
            else:

\section{Evaluation}

Here I have decided to do a visual evaluation showing the injection of some XSS vectors into a text field in the
vulnerable web application \emph{mutillidae}. We'll be using the path \url{mutillidae/index.php?page=dns-lookup.php} to
test on. The video showing this visual testing can be found on GitHub together with the code in a subdirectory called
\verb|evaluation|. The link can be found in the Introduction, Section~\ref{sec:introduction}.

You will find two videos in the mentioned subdirectory, one showing the testing of reflected XSS attacks and one
showing the testing of persistent XSS attacks.  The filenames will indicate which is which. For the small sample of
attacks we test in the video our system blocked all of them.

We planned to do automatic testing using the tool XSSer~\citep*{xsser} in order to evaluate the success rate of our Intrusion
Prevention System, but there were issues getting XSSer to evaluate the performance correctly, so we have ended up
taking a small sample of the XSS vectors that XSSer is using and typing them in manually to see the response.

The results of these manual tests are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:evaluation}.

\begin{table}
    \caption{A test of a sample of XSS vectors from the XSSer tool.}
    \label{tab:evaluation}
    \begin{tabular}{c|p{.5\linewidth}}
        No. of XSS vectors tested & Percentage blocked by our system \\\hline
        25 & \(\frac{21}{25}\cdot100\% = 84\%\)
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In order to give a more comprehensive analysis of the performance of our system we would have to insert a lot more
XSS vectors -- the XSSer tool tests around 550 vectors, it is not feasible to do this manually.



\section{Conclusion}

After having gone through the background for our work, the design of the system, and some results of evaluating it,
we are ready to talk about some lessons learnt during the work and also to point forward to further work that can be
done in this area.

\subsection{Lessons learnt}

Since the work on this project was started the OWASP Top 10 for 2017~\citep*{owasp2017} has been released, and on this
list XSS has been relegated for second place in 2013 to seventh place today. From this we can say that the importance of
this work has diminished a bit since it was undertaken, since OWASP have prioritised it lower on their list of the
top web application vulnerabilities.

During the work it was also discovered that analysis of SSL packets is challenging, and neigh on impossible if we are
dealing with a security conscious user that has configured their web server correctly to only use ECDH or ECDHE ciphers
we don't have a chance to decrypt the traffic even though we would have access to the private key since our solution
is deployed serverside. An alternative could be to redirect the traffic through a proxy on the server and get the
decrypted traffic that way, but we haven't looked into that, hence our solution is currently limited to servers without
SSL configured, which makes its usability limited to the security conscious user, who would naturally have SSL enabled
on their web server.

\subsection{Further work}

Three things could, and should, be done to develop the current solution further:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First upon dropping a packet we should give proper feedback to the client instead of just letting it time out.
\item The Machine Learning classifier should be improved by adding more features to it, i.e. the vocabulary should be
expanded with more keywords from XSS attacks. In addition to that more Machine Learning algorithms should be trained and
compared to the current one.
\item The solution should be expanded to also deal with SSL traffic, which is de-facto for websites in 2017.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Deployment instructions}

As mentioned in the Introduction, Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, we get the deployment files from the \verb|deployment|
subdirectory of the GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/sigmundv/xss-prevent-py}.

In there we find a file \verb|docker-compose.yml|, which contains the necessary instructions to spin up PHP, nginx and
MariaDB, along with CouchDB, on your server. You start this stack using the command \verb|docker-compose up -d|, so make
sure that \verb|docker| and \verb|docker-compose| are installed on your server.

Inside the \verb|deployment| directory you will find a subdirectory called \verb|public|. Download and extract the DVWA
and Mutillidae applications into this directory, which will make them available. In order for these applications to work
you have to change the configuration to point to database host \verb|mariadb|. For DVWA the database user should
be set to \verb|dvwa|, and the database password ditto, in the file \verb|config/config.inc.php|. For Mutillidae the
corresponding settings are found in the file \verb|classes/MySQLHandler.php|. Here you set the \verb|root| password to
\verb|admin|, but if you want a better password you can change it in \verb|docker-compose.yml| and reinitialise the mariadb
container.

In order to deploy our system on your server first make sure that you have Python 3 installed (along with Python header
files). After that you can install the necessary libraries by running \verb|pip3 install -r requirements.txt| as the
root user. Now you are ready to run our Intrusion Prevention System. We haven't daemonised it, so you can run it in a
\verb|screen| session, which you start with \verb|screen -S <name of session>|. Including the name makes it easier to
resume the section after you have detached from it, which would be \verb|screen -r <name of session>|.

In the newly opened \verb|screen| session you change to the root user and run our system with the command
\verb|python3 sniffer.py --destination <IP of the server> --port <port the web server is listening on>|.

Now you are done, and your web applications are protected to a large degree from XSS attacks.

% biography section

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

%\begin{IEEEbiography}{Michael Shell}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiography}

% if you will not have a photo at all:
%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies
%\newpage

%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Jane Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
